<p>One inmate in a rural Pennsylvania prison tested positive for the coronavirus on January 7. Within two weeks, hundreds of his fellow inmates were sick, and Forest County became the national leader in cases per capita.</p>
<p>The episode highlighted one of the most vexing among many difficult problems that have emerged during the pandemic – how to keep incarcerated people virus-free, not only for their own health but for the health of people in the surrounding community.</p>

<p>“Prisons are not islands. There's guards, there's food handlers, there's administrators, there's visitors. If you let them turn into super-spreaders, you're putting everybody at risk,” says Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist and the founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University.</p>
<p>Forest county reached an average of 1,303 new cases per 100,000 people last week, more than any other area in the country, and at least 80% of the total number of cases are linked to the Forest State Correctional Institution (SCI).</p>
<p>The first inmate that tested positive likely contracted the virus from an asymptomatic staff member. “In November and December, there was a significant increase in community spread across all 67 Pennsylvania counties to include Forest County, and specifically the counties that surround the SCI Forest, where a majority of their staff reside,” says Pennsylvania Department of Corrections spokesperson, Maria Bivens. “Several of the staff at SCI Forest also have significant others who are in the healthcare field, first responders and teachers.”</p>
<p>The prison facility turned into a covid-19 hotbed. Only two weeks after one inmate housed in a dorm-type unit tested positive, the total number of cases in the county spiked from 354 to 1245. By now, 1 out of 5 Forest residents have already contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Even though covid-19 cases in the state are high but slowly decreasing, Forest County is still considered an extremely high-risk area. Last Monday, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections completed a mass-testing program at SCI Forest and informed that 751 inmates and 24 members of staff are classified as active positive cases.</p>
<p>“The inmate population is vulnerable. The inmates tend to have more chronic illnesses which put them at greater risk. Particularly in Pennsylvania, we have a lot of older residents at correctional facilities,” says Cornelius J Clancy, Director of XDR Pathogen Lab, and associate chief of infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Since the pandemic began, 141 staff members and 958 inmates have tested positive, and three have died at SCI Forest. But inmates and non-medical staff have not been included in Pennsylvania’s ‘phase 1A’ of the vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>Caplan says that there is a moral and scientific obligation to include prisons in all vaccination plans and argues that “not vaccinating jails is a function of stigma, hatred, and probably a little bit of Hollywood depicting everybody in a jail as a serial killer or mass rapist. Also, prisons are full of minorities, and there's racism involved in ignoring them”.</p>
<p>Until the vaccine is available, the Department of Health spokesperson, Maggi Baron, says they will keep performing case investigations and contact tracing for prison employees and inmates to prevent future outbreaks.</p>
