                        <p>In the midst of the pandemic, Frank Coumo, an expert in criminal law from Nevada, found out his identity was stolen. He received a phone call from his law firm, saying somebody had filed an unemployment claim on his behalf. The Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation (DETR) had sent authentication letters asking if several of the attorneys working at the firm had been laid off.  But Coumo and the others were still employed and working from home.</p>
<p>Coumo reported the crime to the Police Department, but until today, he doesn’t know the exact amount of money that was mistakenly sent out and hasn't received any information about the status of the investigation that began eight months ago.</p>
<p>“Identity thefts targeting unemployment claims were hitting Las Vegas like crazy. Law firms, accounting firms, medical offices.  I'm not the only one. There were several people that have been affected,” says Coumo.</p>

<p class='label-text super-font'>The state has the higher rate in the country</p>

<p>Coumo is just one of the 8,000 residents in Nevada that were victims of online identity theft during covid-19. Identity theft is a type of cybercrime where someone steals your personal information, like your Social Security number, and uses it to commit theft or fraud. Never before has the number of identity thefts been so high.</p>
<p>“The pandemic was a perfect storm for cybercriminals: confusion, trust and a sense of urgency. The best example is unemployment frauds. People were losing their jobs, offices were closed, people were not meeting in person, authentication processes were reduced, and you had a benefit greater than $600 a week. It was a honeypot for frauds,” says Eva Velasquez, President of the Identity Theft Resource Center.</p>
<p>All over the US, the number of cybercrime victims reached records high last year as fraudsters exploited the fear and uncertainty of the pandemic. Cybercriminals mainly attempted to steal personal information to access covid-19 relief benefits, as reported by the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center. But even though all states were targeted, Nevada’s cybercrime victims more than doubled and identity thefts went from 300 to 8,000 in just a year.</p>
<p>Experts believe there is not a single cause for the uprise. But they suggest that the unexpected increase in unemployment during the pandemic, data breaches from the past, old government websites and lack of resources for prosecution, may have pushed criminals to take advantage of Nevada residents.</p>

<p>“In Nevada, the gaming and entertainment industry suffered greatly during the pandemic. I think it’s possible, there is a correlation between the number of jobs lost and the rise of identity theft,” says Samuel Visner, Director of the National Cybersecurity Federally Funded Research and Development Center at the MITRE Corporation.</p>
<p>In April 2020, Nevada’s unemployment was 29.5%, the highest rate ever recorded in any state and month since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking state unemployment in 1976. Nowadays, the unemployment rate has decreased but Nevada still has one of the highest in the country.</p>
<p>According to experts, DETR was not prepared and didn’t have the resources to verify every applicant's identity and work status before sending the payments for people seeking benefits. “Hitting DETR was easy. It was a mess, it was in shambles, it was not prepared. They never saw the onslaught of claims coming,” says Cuomo, who worked as Chief Deputy District Attorney for Clark County for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Velasquez also points out that many state online systems had not been upgraded and were operating with an inadequate cyberinfrastructure. “There was much more money involved. The infrastructure was antiquated. The authentication processes were reduced significantly. They were so overwhelmed with applications that they couldn't legitimate the requests.”</p>
<p>The DETR spokesperson, Rosa Mendez, argues that no data breaches were detected. “Our staff works very closely with our technology vendors, to monitor and make sure our sites are safe and are secure.”</p>
<p>But even if no data breaches occurred in 2020, experts agree that cybercriminals may have used information that was stolen during previous years. Criminals were not stealing more data; they were leveraging it.</p>
<p>“There have been thousands of data breaches, specifically in Nevada over the last 15 years, so much data about so many people, so many records, so many identity credentials. It's all out there in the wild. And so, the fraudsters used what was already out there,” says Velasquez.</p>
<p>In April last year, Nevada’s Attorney General Aaron D. Ford announced the creation of the Nevada Covid-19 Task Force “to fight fraud and prosecute those using covid-19 for their own financial gain.” The task force, composed by local, state and federal investigators and prosecutors launched an awareness initiative in June for more individuals to come forward, report allegations, and receive help.</p>
<p>But there is still not enough information to suggest that the task force initiative led to more people filing complaints. “It's hard to tell without all involved agencies auditing their number of complaints. And as law enforcement agencies, we are incredibly limited on what we can share about them,” says Monica Moazes, the Director of Communications of Nevada’s Attorney General Office. “But we have worked with DETRS to augment their existing efforts to combat fraudsters”</p>
<p>Even though there is no public information available about the complaints, the US Attorney’s office in Nevada stated in a December press release that at least ten individuals have been charged in the District of Nevada for their alleged roles in unemployment insurance fraud schemes.</p>
<p>In Nevada, using personal identifying information of another individual with the intent to fraudulently obtain credit, property or services, can be punished with up to twenty years in prison and a $100,000 fine.</p>
<p>“From my experience, and I'm coming from having been a state and federal prosecutor and now defense attorney, there's very little energy effort by law enforcement that's put into identity theft,” says Coumo. The main reason: “Identity theft is happening, all over the world. Your perpetrator may be sitting in Nigeria or in Russia. But the crime is happening here in Las Vegas. And so, does local law enforcement get involved in that? No, because they don't have the resources.”</p>
<p>Identity thefts related to unemployment claims are still escalating and experts believe there will be losses of approximately $100 billion across the United States. Even though some people hope that as the economy recovers, there will be fewer opportunities for cybercriminals, Visner warns there is still a need for prevention and prosecution. “Remember, there is a lot of cybercrime that is not directly monetizable, but it is in the long term.” He also speculates that “criminals will probably shift towards larger and more lucrative targets.”</p>
