                        <p>Corey Robinson can launch into a spirited riff about the quality of his cows.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old Black farmer raises grass-fed Angus and Hereford cattle in northeastern Texas. Forget the pink grocery meat, he said. His was a ruby red. It was pure.</p>
<p>But Robinson’s beef with the U.S. Department of Agriculture—and the Byzantine network of institutions meant to aid Black farmers—is what really gets him going.</p>
<p>Robinson knew after growing up around cattle in Arkansas that he would own a ranch someday. In 2009, he secured a USDA loan and finally leased some land in Sulphur Springs, Texas.</p>
<p>By the next year, however, Robinson was in deep trouble. The farm was sold right from under him, leaving him nowhere to take his 72 cattle. He pleaded with the USDA for a lifeline. It refused to engage, he said, except to demand that the $70,000 loan be repaid.</p>
<p>“They turned their backs on me,” Robinson said. He vowed to start from scratch, and this time without the USDA.</p>
<p>He would soon learn, however, that there were few other options.</p>
<p>Banks and other lending institutions, some designed specifically for farmers, have consolidated for years with little oversight, leaving behind financial deserts that limit loan access for Black farmers.</p>
<p>The USDA is meant to be a last resort. But farmers forced to deal with the agency must contend with its long history of discrimination.</p>
<p>An analysis of previously unreported USDA data, banking numbers and discrimination complaints reveal the way public and commercial lenders have together contributed to Black farmers’ widespread debt and loss of farmland.</p>
<p>“It’s all a network,” said Jillian Hishaw, a former USDA official. “And it’s a network set up for failure.”</p>
<p>The number of Black farmers in the country has decreased at a greater rate than white farmers since 1920. Today, Black farmers account for 1.3 percent of agricultural operations. And compared to white farmers, who make $43,608 on average a year, they make an annual $3,509.</p>
<p>This widening income gap, facilitated by the USDA’s discriminatory lending practices, led Black farmers to file a class action lawsuit in 1997 against the agency.  The lawsuit ended in two separate $1 billion settlements that were meant to finally offer Black farmers a chance to rebound.</p>
<p class='label super-font'>In some states, 6 out of 10 Black farmers were rejected by the USDA in the last 4 years</p>

<p>But 20 years after the lawsuit was settled, the inequities persist: Only 10 percent of USDA loan applications from white farmers were rejected in the past four years, whereas 40 percent of Black farmers were denied, according to data obtained through a public records request.</p>
<p>“We recognize that the federal government, including the USDA, has been responsible for cumulative as well as individual acts of discrimination and racism,” a USDA spokesperson said in an email. “The Department is harnessing new tools and new approaches to ensure civil rights and equity across USDA.”</p>
<p>Robinson was certain his loan would have been denied, too, if the government had not used his house as collateral. But that was a risky gambit—the USDA often forecloses on properties, even those that have been kept within a Black family for generations.</p>
<p>“What they say is, ‘We’re here to help you,’” Robinson said of the agency. “But they don’t.”</p>
<h3>Last resort</h3>
<p>About 10 counties to the south of Robinson in Texas, Brian Hunter, a Black farmer from Seguin, waited for a year and a half to hear back from the USDA about his loan application.</p>
<p>In December 2019, he learned his loan package had been reduced from $180,000 to $20,000. By then, all his supplies and seed banks were closed due to the winter, and he was forced to repay his loans after a hostile season for crops.</p>
<p>The USDA said farm loans are on average disbursed in 26 days after approval, but many Black farmers like Hunter have waited far longer.</p>
<p>In Texas, the state where the most farmers of color have applied for USDA loans since 2017, Black farmers received about half of what their white counterparts were offered on average. Meanwhile, every six in 10 loan applications from Black farmers were rejected.</p>

<p>“I honestly don’t understand how anyone can navigate the clandestine nature in which the USDA conducts business with African Americans,” Hunter said.</p>
<p>Hunter is one of 20 Black farmers who said in interviews that discrimination at the USDA remained unaddressed. The agency, meant to be a safety net for farmers unable to get credit elsewhere, has a vast patchwork of local officials who possess kingmaking powers in small communities.</p>
<p>John Boyd, for one, recalled when a local USDA official tossed his loan application into the trash and called him “colored.”</p>
<p>“There's nothing wrong with the USDA programs, they have the best programs in the world for farming and agriculture. There is something wrong with the people that administer them throughout the country,” said Boyd, who is president of the National Black Farmers Association.</p>
<p>A USDA spokesperson said the agency did not track the number of local officials fired for discrimination. But Hishaw, the former adjudicator at the USDA civil rights office, said delinquent employees were rarely subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>“They get promoted,” Hishaw said. “They are never called on the carpet.”</p>
<p>After decades of mistreatment, more Black farmers are choosing to forego the agency altogether. In 2020, 762 Black farmers nationwide applied for USDA loans. Sixty percent of them were rejected.</p>
<p>Nicole Mukes, a second-generation Black farmer from Oklahoma, said she would never apply for USDA loans after her father spent his life struggling “without resources” as the agency denied him.</p>
<p>“If I get a loan, and I can’t pay for it, then we lose the land altogether. That’s how it works for us,” Mukes said.</p>
<p>Even if farmers like Mukes applied for a loan, experts said the system had been rigged for so long that they wouldn’t qualify for most of them.</p>
<p>“Nothing has really been done to address the very important inequities in a lot of aspects of our farming operation,” said Cesar Escalante, professor of agricultural economics at University of Georgia.</p>
<p>Debt incurred by minority farmers, now estimated at $4 billion, remains one of the biggest inequities. But the USDA does not compile a breakdown of the number of outstanding loans owed by Black farmers, an agency spokesperson confirmed.</p>

<p>These figures would be necessary to disburse the debt relief passed in March under the Biden administration’s COVID-19 stimulus package, which included $5 billion for farmers of color.</p>
<p>The law was heralded as the most significant civil rights legislation in decades, but with the USDA in charge of developing guidelines for the payout, Black farmers are skeptical about its enforcement.</p>
<p>The agency said it was working with Black farmers “to ensure the loan payoff is structured in a way that does not negatively impact their operations or credit.”</p>
<p>But advocates believe a neutral third party should be tasked with disbursement.</p>
<p>“We shouldn't have to go back—to go through the same person who discriminated against us—to execute debt relief,” Boyd said. “It's like I said, the fox watching the henhouse.”</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>‘Triple whammy’</h3>
<p>The USDA is not the only entity Boyd has clashed with.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2019, two Sun Belt banks—BB&amp;T and SunTrust—filed for a merger. The companies were little known outside the southeast, but the deal sent a seismic wave through the industry: The $66-billion merger would make the combined bank the sixth largest in the country.</p>
<p>Boyd emerged as the merger’s most vocal foe. He urged the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System to reject the application, citing the banks’ own assertions that rural branches would be closed to cut $1.6 billion in annual costs after the merger.</p>
<p>A letter to the Fed from Boyd’s National Black Farmers Association argued the merger would lead to far less favorable loans for tens of thousands of its members in the Black Belt, where the banks had their largest footprint.</p>
<p>By winter, however, the merger had the Fed seal of approval.</p>
<p>Commercial banks, which provide 40 percent of agricultural loans, should be an ideal first stop for Black farmers—a robust credit source that would prevent them from needing to turn to the USDA.</p>
<p>But unfettered mergers—juiced by a lack of federal oversight—spurred closures and cuts to services that have turned a potentially promising alternative into a dead end for Black farmers.</p>
<p>Stella Adams, president of S J Adams Consulting, a North Carolina firm focused on fair lending, said consolidation in the industry has had a “horrific” impact on rural areas as community banks, which are typically more willing to provide credit, are shuttered.</p>
<p>“It has been a double, triple whammy on Black farmers in particular,” Adams said.</p>
<p>The BB&amp;T and SunTrust merger was the latest in a longtime trend. The share of banks with more than $10 billion in assets grew from about a quarter of the industry 35 years ago to 84 percent now, according to the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ nonpartisan think tank.</p>
<p>In a 2019 report, the think tank pointed to mergers as the biggest driver of the decline in small banks—even more than bank failures and a slowdown in new bank openings.</p>
<p>“Any bank that tells you different is just gaslighting,” said Jason Richardson, research and evaluation director of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.</p>
<p>Mergers must be approved by the Fed, which is required to evaluate the impact a deal would have on rural communities. Many see the body, however, as a rubber stamp.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the agency has not rejected a single merger application.</p>
<p>It approved 3,506 over the same period, according to Fed data. And it is greenlighting them at record pace—even ones hit with public complaints. These more controversial mergers took three months on average to be approved in 2018, less than half the time it took six years prior.</p>
<p>When branches close as a result of mergers, rural and minority areas feel the ensuing strangle on credit access most acutely. Less examined is how this plays out among Black farmers, who sit at the nexus of both communities.</p>
<p>An analysis of banking data in the 10 counties with the highest rates of Black farmers paints a bleak picture. Six had three or less banks remaining in 2020. Only one had gained a bank since 2017.</p>
<p>Across the southeast U.S., meanwhile, at least two-thirds of counties with one bank left had a higher rate of Black farmers than the country as a whole. And there is no guarantee those banks offer agricultural loans, which often demand regional expertise and a deep knowledge of farming.</p>
<p>Four southeast counties with one bank left were not included, as they had no demographic data.</p>
<p>Richardson said rural and metropolitan counties alike were falling victim to these trends.</p>
<p>“If you're a farmer though in a rural county, and the local bank closes, indications are that nobody's coming to help,” he said.</p>
<h3>Fraught alternative</h3>
<p>Barriers against commercial credit access are not new to rural farmers. The federal government itself recognized as much at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>To remediate the issue, the government established 12 federal banks in 1916 and another dozen in 1923. These banking cooperatives—now part of a government-sponsored private enterprise called the Farm Credit System—were supposed to expand credit access for rural farmers where the commercial banks did not.</p>
<p>But about a century later, these efforts have mostly failed Black farmers.</p>
<p>Like commercial banks, the Farm Credit System has consolidated dramatically since its genesis. It has reduced from 37 banks and more than 1,000 associations in 1981 to four banks and 67 associations today—again raising questions about the private sector’s ability to meet the lending needs of Black farmers.</p>
<p>The Farm Credit System makes up 40 percent of all agricultural loans but just about a quarter of all loans made to minority farmers. The System’s programs have only “limited effect” on the credit provided to these farmers, a 2019 Government Accountability Office report found, because it does not target minority groups in its outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The Farm Credit Administration, the System’s federal regulator, explained that the disparity has to do with the fact that federal laws prohibit the collection of race-based data. But Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers Association, said outreach efforts were scarce at best.</p>
<p>“They never presented or spoke in our conference,” Boyd said. “And I ask them every year.”</p>
<p>Unlike the USDA, Farm Credit System institutions are not subject to mandatory lending goals that oblige them to lend to minority farmers. Neither are they required to consider a farmer’s adverse circumstances in their processing of loan applications, as the federal agency does.</p>
<p>Escalante, the agricultural economics professor, said Farm Credit System institutions are often not viable options for Black farmers as a result.</p>
<p>One Black farmer in South Carolina had been stonewalled by 12 different banks in his town when he approached his local Farm Credit System bank, ArborOne, for a loan to support his 5-acre hemp, herbal and floral farm in September 2019.</p>
<p>But ArbroOne, too, turned him away, citing that it did not finance hemp-related projects as a matter of policy—except it did, in fact, begin financing them earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Still, the bank ran a hard inquiry into the farmer’s credit account, which “ruined” his credit score, according to a complaint obtained through a public records request.</p>
<p>The farmer alleged that racial discrimination played a role in the bank’s mishandling of his loan application. But in its complaint review, the Farm Credit Administration said the loan officer simply missed the new policy on hemp financing.</p>
<p>The damage was irreversible, however: Now with a credit score of 640, the farmer was at risk of being ineligible for “last resort” financing options offered by the USDA.</p>
<p>“He hoped that ArborOne is told they need to give people a fair shot,”  a Farm Credit Administration employee wrote in an internal memo. “He wanted the association to be fair to people who looked like him.”</p>
<p>But in this instance and at least five more since 2015, the Farm Credit Administration failed to offer personal redress for allegations of racial discrimination. It even said it was incapable of doing so, according to half a dozen responses to complaints.</p>
<p>The Administration told the six complainants only that it was reviewing the banks for alleged violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. It could not, however, disclose its findings to the complainants or offer monetary relief.</p>
<p>One state south on the Atlantic coast, a Farm Credit System bank named AgGeorgia forced a different farmer to file for bankruptcy after he had stood up for a fellow Black borrower’s issues with the bank, a discrimination complaint alleged.</p>
<p>AgGeorgia later denied remedies the bankruptcy court had approved for the farmer—turning around instead to foreclose on the fourth-generation farm and quickly reselling it.</p>
<p>The complainant said at least four other Black farmers were targeted by this “undercover scheme” that needed to be exposed, according to an internal memo.</p>
<p>Boyd, too, said foreclosures on Black farms through predatory lending practices are as commonplace within the Farm Credit System as they are at the USDA.</p>
<h3>Growing movement</h3>
<p>For years, the USDA threatened to foreclose the 200-acre farm that Rick Brown’s father had inherited from three generations before him.</p>
<p>His father eventually repaid the loans and reclaimed the North Carolina farm in 2003, when he retired at 87 years old. As his successor, Brown promised to never rely on the federal loans that had endangered their land.</p>
<p>The fourth-generation farmer is bootstrapping his operation these days. His strategy for growth: To expand through self-funding or grants, or not expand at all.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to drive an industry that’s looking to capitalize off of us,” he said.</p>
<p>Brown is part of a growing movement of Black farmers who are reimagining a system of financing that does not involve traditional institutions.</p>
<p>In 2016, Nadia Ruffin, a Black farmer from Cincinnati, Ohio, founded a nonprofit called Agricademy, Inc. to teach people of color how to start small-scale farms. The lack of knowledge of the industry, she said, has caused the number of Black farmers to plunge.</p>
<p>“They think a farmer is just this old white guy with his cows,” said Ruffin. “Nobody's really going into the schools and showing the kids that these are the things that are possible.”</p>
<p>Ruffin trains underrepresented individuals, with an emphasis on the youth. Her courses cover funding, equipment and everything else a person would need to jumpstart their business.</p>
<p>Other farmers are likewise sharing new ideas to survive. Brown, for one, considered putting his family farm in a nonprofit land trust that in essence offers subsidies and cost-share grants in exchange for his assurance that the land would never be sold.</p>
<p>The trust would allow Brown to retain full ownership of his land while guaranteeing that it will be farmed for generations to come. In the meantime, he has been growing organic produce, soybeans and wheat, enabling him to slowly build his wealth without federal aid.</p>
<p>Last Christmas, Brown was approached with an opportunity to purchase a piece of land on the other side of town. It was a 2.5-acre plot he had been visiting every summer.</p>
<p>The land had historical significance—on it was a Civil War-era outhouse, a doctor’s office and parts of a railroad that once transported tobacco to the north.</p>
<p>What moved Brown to purchase the land outright, however, was its personal significance to him. At the end of the war, it was one of the largest slave plantations in North Carolina. Among the 165 enslaved people on the land were Brown’s own predecessors.</p>
<p>Now the land belongs to him.</p>
