                        <p>A young patient walks into the doctor's office at a sexual health center in the Bronx. He quietly sits on the chair, lays his hands on the desk and begins bouncing his right leg while waiting for instructions. He interrupts the silence by cracking his knuckles and looks around the room with his head down to avoid eye contact. The doctor begins asking questions but he nods at him instead of answering. After a few seconds, he says: “I am sorry doc, I am not here for STD testing, I wanted to know more about HIV treatments.”</p>

<p>The patient is just one of the 31,280 people living with HIV in the Bronx. Every year, New York City is closer to achieving its goal to end the HIV epidemic. In 2019, new HIV diagnoses fell to historic levels and New Yorkers with HIV are living longer lives as they become more virally suppressed. But behind these optimistic figures hides a long-standing inequality: the Bronx is the only borough where new HIV diagnoses are increasing.</p>
<p>Since 2015, the Bronx became the borough with the highest HIV rate in the City and it is now the only area where new HIV diagnoses are on the rise. Most experts attribute the high HIV prevalence to socio-economic factors, stigma and failure of prevention efforts among young people in the Bronx.</p>
<p>“In the Bronx community there is still a strong stigma associated with HIV. I can tell some of my patients are embarrassed to talk about sexual health,” says Dr. Raffaele M. Bernardo, infectious disease specialist at the Oval Center - Montefiore Health System in the Bronx. “Stigma is one of the most significant barriers to accessing care and treatment. And of course, there is also poverty and inequalities that play even a larger role.”</p>

<p>The Bronx has been historically the most underserved borough in New York City, and experts have proven that socio-economic deprivation is a major driver of HIV. “High rates of poverty, housing instability, unemployment, food insecurity means that healthcare becomes less of a priority in individuals' lives,” says Patrick McGovern, Amida Care’s Chief of Business Development and Policy Officer. “And that leads to decreased access and higher rates of chronic medical conditions, including HIV.”</p>
<p>The three poorest neighborhoods with the highest HIV rates are located in the Bronx: HighBridge -Morrisania, Crotona-Tremont and Hunts -Point Haven, according to poverty data from the Environment and Health Data Portal and HIV statistics from the Annual Surveillance Reports. Those are also the neighborhoods with the lowest proportions of virally suppressed people living with HIV.</p>

<p>“Poverty shapes risk, it increases the likelihood to be exposed to risk. But that does not mean that poor people are more likely to be risky,” clarifies Vincent Guilamo-Ramos, Director of NYU Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health. “Sexual risk behavior happens across all income and educational attainment groups.”</p>
<p>In New York City, minority communities are disproportionately impacted by poverty, further contributing to elevated contextual HIV risk. More than 90% of new HIV diagnoses in the city are among minority residents. Last year in the Bronx, the borough with the largest proportion of Latino residents, only 10 White residents were diagnosed with HIV out of all 466.</p>
<p>“Minorities are affected by a series of factors that determine lower levels of access to health care, HIV preventive measures, and lower levels of information about new biomedical methods to prevent and treat HIV,” says Luis A. Mares, director of Community Mobilization Programs at the Latino Commission on AIDS.</p>

<p>The factors described by Mares not only include low economic status, but also lack of services tailored in a cultural and linguistically appropriate way, and place of residence. This last point is related to where medical services are located. In the Bronx, there are fewer primary care providers than any other borough. The majority of the neighborhoods are designated by Health Resources and Services Administration as underserved medical and health professional shortage areas.</p>
<p>Data from NYC Health also proves that most venues that actively distribute free safer sex products and pre-exposure prophylaxis clinics are located in Manhattan. Less than 20% of those centers are located in the Bronx.</p>

<p>Experts agree that residents under 30 are the most affected by the lack of access to medical care related to HIV prevention. “Young people have too often been invisible in the fight against HIV. As a result HIV prevention and treatment efforts are too often misaligned with the unique needs of youth,” says Guilamo-Ramos.</p>
<p>In fact, the increase in new HIV diagnoses in the Bronx is primarily driven by young people. Among people aged 30 and older, new HIV Diagnoses remain stable, but for younger Bronx residents, HIV diagnoses increased by 17% in just one year.</p>
<p>Dr. Bernardo believes one possible way to revert this trend is to “bring up the conversation. The more you talk about something, the more likely you are to remove stigma.” He thinks it is key to “assure patient confidentiality and create a sex positive environment that will allow patients to open up.”</p>
<p>Even though the HIV epidemic is almost over, “more should be done” to eradicate structural racism and all the social factors that perpetuate the inequity. “We need targeted efforts, almost zip code by zip code, to address those social determinants. HIV is as much a function of where you live as of who you are and what you do,” says McGovern.</p>
